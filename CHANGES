4.2 2020-06-21
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* VISAN no longer depends on packages of the default anaconda channel, but uses
  conda-forge for its dependencies. VISAN itself is now available in the
  stcorp-forge channel.

* Fix compatibility issues with wxPython 4.1 and VTK 9.

4.1 2020-03-31
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added display of political borders in worldmap plots (using GSHHG).
  Inner lakes are now also displayed by default as these are often part
  of a political border.

* Fixed error in filedialog when trying to save an image for a plot.

* Fixed error in using spin controls (used for e.g. speed of animation plot).

4.0 2019-10-31
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Upgraded all VISAN source code to be compatible with Python 3, wxPython 4,
  and VTK 8.

* VISAN is no longer a self contained application but can only be installed
  in a conda environment (using e.g. Anaconda or Miniconda).
  External dependencies of VISAN such as wxPython and VTK, but also CODA and
  HARP are no longer included with VISAN, but will now be automatically
  installed into the VISAN conda environment as external packages.
  This approach now also allows for easy addition of other python packages to
  be used in VISAN by installing them in the same conda environment.
  
* Changed Open Source licence of VISAN from GPLv2 to BSD (3-Clause).

* Updated VISAN icon and splash screen based on new Atmospheric Toolbox
  visuals.

3.20 2019-05-03
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Allow wplot() to use corner lat/lon coordinates that are [..,2] instead of
  [..,4] (i.e. representing a bounding box).

* Updated packages to the following versions:
  - CODA 2.21
  - HARP 1.6

3.19 2018-12-18
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Removed deprecated BEAT-II interfaces from VISAN.
  All examples and documentation have been converted to use HARP.

* The plot() and wplot() functions now accept harp.Variable objects as
  arguments.

* The plot() and wplot() functions can now use *_bounds variables from HARP
  products as axis variables by automatically calculating the mid points and
  using those for the axis.

* The default installation path on Windows is now C:\Program Files\VISAN.

* The CODA and HARP documentation are no longer included with VISAN. All
  documentation references now point to the publicly available CODA/HARP
  documentation.

* Updated packages to the following versions:
  - CODA 2.20
  - HARP 1.5

3.18.1 2018-08-03
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed issue where Windows binary installer did not contain all codadef files
  (which prevented several products from being opened with CODA and HARP).

* Fixed issue where the HARP Import dialog would not work on Windows because
  the '\' in a product path was treated as an escape character.

3.18 2018-07-12
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed issue where y-axis of plots in productbrowser was invalid if the data
  contained NaN values.

* Fixed issue where VISAN would not start due to a missing libffi.so.6 library.

  - HARP 1.3

3.17 2017-09-29
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Revised HARP ingest/import dialog to use the new combined
  harp.import_product() functionality that can read both HARP products and
  ingest from external formats.

* Fixed issue where data inside the plotting routines were sometimes still
  treated as single precision floating point values which could result into
  precision loss.

* Fixed built-in CODA documentation.

* VISAN application on macOS is now a single VISAN.app instead of a VISAN
  folder containing the .app and other files. This should resolve the
  issue where moving the VISAN application to the /Applications folder
  did not remove the quarantine property on the application.

* Fixed issue where beatl2.ingest() was not working on Windows.

* Fix compatibility with building on latest macOS versions.

* Updated packages to the following versions:
  - CODA 2.18.3

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added 'location' tab in the dataset property panel of the 2D plot which can
  be used to show a worldmap plot with the location of the 2D data.

* Wildcards in the HARP ingestion dialog are now passed on to HARP because
  they can now be handled by HARP itself.

* Added example scripts for AEOLUS L1b/L2a/L2b.

* Updated packages to the following versions:

  choice between harp.import_product() and harp.ingest_product().

* The Linux binary installers of VISAN no longer include their own versions of
  the libstdc++ and libgcc_s libraries.

* Fixed issue where the product browser was raising IA__gdk_window_thaw_updates
  failed assertions and where the part of the window that had the buttons to
  select between grid and plot view was not shown correctly.

* Fixed issue where the dimension selection controls for the plots in the
  product browser were not doing anything on Mac OS X.

* Fixed issue where plotting HARP products could fail if the HARP product
  contained scalar variables.

* Animation plots for HARP products now have fields shown in the attribute
  panel.

* Updated packages to the following versions:
  - HARP 0.4

3.13 2016-10-03
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The HARP ingestion dialog now allows for wildcards in the filename.
  This will translate to a more complex python command line call that performs
  a harp.concatenate() on a list of ingests using the glob() result of the
  pattern.

* Improved automatic selection of variables to use for plotting when plotting
  a HARP Product.

* Updated packages to the following versions:
  - CODA 2.17.3
  - BEAT 6.10.1
  - HARP 0.3

  This also introduces dependencies on cffi/libffi/pycparser/setuptools,
  which are now included in the VISAN distribution packages.

* Added HARP ingestion dialog (available in the 'File' menu) to easily
  construct and execute the right harp.ingest_product() call.

* Allow plotting of HARP Products using the plot() and wplot() commands.

* Several changes/fixes to wplot()
  - removed artifacts in grid plotting that would interpolate
    towards the poles and/or accross datelines.
    (i.e. AddGridData() can now be used to plot sub-grids).
  - also fixed other plotting issues that could appear even
    if the grid covered the full earth.
  - allow plotting of gridded data using wplot (this was previously
    only possible by calling AddGridData() on an existing wplot instance).

* Fixed issue where changing plot properties using text boxes did not
  work on OSX.

  interface and function interface) as well.

* Linux version of VISAN now uses the Gtk2 backend of wxPython.

* Mac OS X version of VISAN now uses the Carbon backend of wxPython.
  It is no longer needed to have X11 installed to run VISAN on Mac OS X.

* Creating plots of data with multiple frames (e.g. spectral data, worldmap
  gridded data) is now much much faster.

* The plot functions have been adapted such that they will now accept the
  BEAT-II records from the new BEAT-II implementation in BEAT 5.0.0.

    Pressing 'R' will now always go back to a range based on the min/max values
    of the data in the plot
  - Improved Dataset property panel (based on new BEAT-II implementation)

* Changes to wplot()
  - Added Dataset property panel (based on new BEAT-II implementation)
  - The color table editor is now integrated in the Dataset property panel and
    greatly revised
  - the order of the latitude and longitude parameters to wplot() when plotting
    locations has been reversed (latitude now comes before longitude)

* Updated packages to the following versions:
  - Python 2.4.4
  - BEAT 5.0.0
  - HDF5 1.6.5

* Removed BEAT shared libraries from VISAN binary distributions, since they
  were not used (the BEAT(L2)-Python modules are already linked with the
  static versions of the BEAT libraries).

1.2.0 2005-04-08
