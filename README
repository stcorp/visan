                VISAN 4.2 Release Notes

VISAN is a Visualisation and Analysis application that was designed to be a
front-end for CODA and HARP, but is general enough to be appropriate for a much
wider range of applications. VISAN provides a full Python command line interface
that allows you to read and inspect instrument product data via CODA or HARP,
manipulate the data, and create advanced 2D Plots and Worldplots.

The currently supported platforms are Windows 10, Linux, and macOS (10.9 and
higher).


Installation
============

VISAN is available exclusively as a conda package.

For Linux, make sure that you have X11, OpenGL libraries, and Gtk 2.x
(including Glib 2.x, Pango, ATK, etc.) installed.

To install the binary version for your platform you will first need to install
Anaconda or Miniconda, then activate the conda environment in which you want to
install VISAN. We recommend creating a dedicated environment for VISAN:

$ conda create -n visan
$ conda activate visan

and within this environment install VISAN itself using:

$ conda install -c stcorp-forge -c conda-forge visan=4.2

The VISAN application can then be found in your conda environment.


To build VISAN from source, clone the VISAN github repository and create a
conda environment with the VISAN application as follows:

$ conda env create -f environment.yml
$ conda activate visan-build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$CONDA_PREFIX
$ make install


Documentation

Full documentation in HTML is included with the VISAN software.
